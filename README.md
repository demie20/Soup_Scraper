# Soup_Scraper
This is my very first scraper. It's for the website: https://www.franklywearing.com/

1. The libraries I've used are BeautifulSoup and Requests. 
2. It generates a csv file consisting of the columns : names and products

Since, this is my first attempt at web scraping, the code is quite simple and basic. I'll be improving the same over time :)
