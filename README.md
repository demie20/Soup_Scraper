# Soup_Scraper
This is my very first scraper. It's for the website: https://www.franklywearing.com/

1. The libraries I've used are BeautifulSoup and Requests. 
2. It generates a csv file consisting of the following columns : names and products
3. The csv file is generated in the same directory as the python file.
